Mailman Memberlist
==============

The Mailman HTML code is quite horrible and it is not possible to copy & paste the members of a mailing list into another application.

This script logs in to mailman and extracts the email addresses and names.

Usage:

    ./memberlist.rb -d domain.tld -l listname -p password
